JSON-Patch proof-of-concept: Shows how to accept JSON-Patch requests in JAX-RS.
========================
This project is based on Pete Muir & Co's excellent [kitchensink-angularjs quickstart on JDF](http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/jboss-as-quickstart/kitchensink-angularjs/).
(project forked from https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jboss-as-quickstart).

This project also uses Francis Galiegue's (json-patch)[https://github.com/fge/json-patch] java (Jackson) library and Joachim Wester's (JSON-Patch)[https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/JSON-Patch] javascript library to implement JSON-Patch requests on both the server side (JAX-RS) and the client side (AngularJS).
